# rock-paper-scissors-project
Rock, paper, scissors project for The Odin Project.

Notes about how it is going to work.

- The game is going to play against the computer.
- Create a function called 'getComputerChoice' that will randomly return either 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'.
- This function will make the computer play.


- Write a function that plays a single round of rock, paper, scissors.
- The function should take two parameters, the player selection and the computer selection.
- Then return a string that declares the winner of the match like so: 'You lose! Paper beats rock.'
- Make your function playerSelection parameter case-insensitive.


IMPORTANT NOTE: You want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() them.

- Write a new function called 'game()'. 
- Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
